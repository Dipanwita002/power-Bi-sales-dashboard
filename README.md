# 📊 Power BI Dashboard — Understanding Business through Data

Welcome to **DASH.pbix**, a Power BI dashboard project crafted to transform raw business data into clear, interactive insights. This dashboard represents more than just visuals — it tells the story of operational decisions, performance monitoring, and the rhythm of a business through its data.

## 📖 The Story Behind the Dashboard

In the fast-paced world of business, data often sits in silos, hidden in spreadsheets or disconnected systems. This dashboard is a response to that challenge — a tool built to unify, visualize, and empower decision-makers.

The goal? To help stakeholders — from managers to analysts — quickly understand the **status of key business metrics** without needing to dig through raw files.
